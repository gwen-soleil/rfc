The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Tango Property Specification

 A Property is a persisted item of Tango that is mainly used for configuration purposes. 4 types of properties exist:

 *  Class property: a property that is attached to a Device Class (cf RFC-9). This property is accessible from all devices of the class
 *  Device property: a property that is attached to a Device (RFC-2). This property is accessible from only one device
 *  Attribute property: a property that is attached to an Attribute (RFC-4).
 *  Free property: TODO

### Goals

 The specification of Property aims to define a standard structure and type to use in any implementation of Tango.

Additionally, it aims to:

* Provide the initial information when one starts a Tango Device

* Be usable as keeping global variable in the Tango control system

* Provide meta data complementing any data in Tango


### Use Cases

There are many use cases for the usage of a Property:

* To connect a real network equipment a Property can define the target IP address

* To change the representation of an information in order to be more user friendly a Property can define a new data format for the graphical user interface to convert the raw data.

* TODO: Memorized Attribute


## Specification

A Tango Property is a strict definition of a pair of key/value
* The Property SHALL have one key, called Property Name
* The Property SHALL have one value, called Property Value
* If the device is started upon a Tango Database, Class, Device, Attribute and Free Properties MUST BE be persisted into the Tango Database (RFC6)
* If the device is started without a Tango Database, the device and class properties MUST BE persisted in a file (but no support for the attribute properties) 
* All device and class properties SHOULD be directly modified and accessed througth the database device or its file
* Attribute properties SHOULD be modified and accessed at any time througth the device object (RFC-2)
* All default attribute and device properties are OPTIONAL
* The attribute, class and device properties MAY BE defined in the device code and they MAY BE OPTIONAL OR REQUIRED (mandatory)
* TODO memorized attributes, system properties
* TODO : properties history
* TODO: error management
* All device and class properties MUST be loaded at init command or device start-up
* If a device property does not exist, the device MUST load its class property
* All device and class properties SHOULD be modified and accessed througth the database device (RFC-6)
* A Tango device MUST manage the following default device properties: cmd_min_poll_period, min_poll_period, attr_min_poll_period, poll_ring_depth, cmd_poll_ring_depth, attr_poll_ring_depth, polled_attr, logging_target, logging_level, logging_rft (TODO: description of each one)
* An attribute MUST manage the following default attribute properties (TODO: descriptions):
	 * String **label** default value "";
	 * String **description** default value  "No description"
	 * String **unit** default value "No unit"
	 * String **standard_unit** default value "No standard unit"
	 * String **display_unit** default value "No display unit"
	 * String **format** default value :
	   * attribute type is a string, "%s"
	   * attribute type is float or double, "%6.2f"
	   * "Not specified" otherwise
  	 * String **min_value** default value "Not specified"
         * String **max_value** default value  "Not specified"
         * String **min_alarm** default value "Not specified"
         * String **max_alarm** default value  "Not specified"
         * String **min_warning** default value  "Not specified"
  	 * String **max_warning** default value  "Not specified"
  	 * String **delta_t** default value  "Not specified"
  	 * String **delta_val** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **abs_change** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **rel_change** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **event_period** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **archive_period** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **archive_rel_change** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **archive_abs_change** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **enum_labels** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **__root_att** default value "Not specified"
	 * String **enum_labels**
	 * String **__value**


### Naming convention
* The Property's Name SHALL use the following convention:
``` ABNF
property-name = 1*VCHAR
```
* The property name is case insensitive
* The Property value MUST use the following convention:
  * single value that may contains any caracter
  * or an array with carriage return
  * special values: "NaN", "inf"
* TODO nodbproperties file convention
